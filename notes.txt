Box Geometry
(six parameters)
width: the size on the x axis
height: the size on the y axis
depth: the size on the z axis
widthSegments: How many subdivisions on the x axis
heightSegments: How many subdivisions on the y axis
depthSegments: How many subdivisions on the z axis

Segments control how many faces 
1 = two triangles
2 = eight triangles



Mipmapping is a technique that consists of creating half a smaller version of a texture again and again until we get 1x1 texture
Texture variations are sent to GPU, which chooses most appropriate version of the texture


Create your own matcaps
3D software
Render a sphere in front of the camera in a square image

2D software (like PS)
Use soft brushes on a square image(bg) and paint where you want light reflections
